## ⚙️ AWS Services Used

- **AWS IoT Core** – Receive IoT telemetry data via MQTT.
- **AWS Kinesis Data Streams** – Stream IoT data to processing layer.
- **AWS Lambda** – Process data and analyze images.
- **Amazon DynamoDB** – Store structured traffic data.
- **Amazon S3** – Store images from traffic cameras.
- **Amazon Rekognition** – Detect vehicles and congestion from images.
- **Amazon QuickSight** – Visualize traffic analytics.
- **Amazon SNS** – Send alerts in case of accidents/congestion.

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

1. **Deploy IoT Simulator**
   - Run `iot_simulator.py` to publish sample telemetry data.

2. **Set Up AWS IoT Core**
   - Create IoT Thing, attach certificates, and configure MQTT topic rules.

3. **Configure Kinesis + Lambda**
   - Create Kinesis Data Stream.
   - Attach Lambda (`lambda_process_data/index.py`) as trigger to process and push to DynamoDB.

4. **Set Up S3 + Rekognition Lambda**
   - Upload images to S3 bucket.
   - Trigger `lambda_image_analysis/index.py` on new uploads to analyze using Rekognition.

5. **Configure QuickSight Dashboard**
   - Connect DynamoDB as a dataset source.
   - Create visualizations for live traffic data.

6. **Set Up SNS Alerts**
   - Configure SNS topic to send congestion/accident alerts from Lambda.

## 📸 Screenshots

Include screenshots of your QuickSight dashboard in the `dashboard/quicksight_screenshots` folder.

---

## 📌 Notes

- Make sure to configure proper IAM roles and permissions for each AWS service.
- All Lambda functions should have environment variables configured for their respective table/bucket/topic names.
